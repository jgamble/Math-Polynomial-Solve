This package provides a set of functions that find the roots of
polynomials up to degree 4 using the classical methods; a function
for solving polynomials of any degree by an implementation of the
QR Hessenberg algorithm; and functions that implement Sturm's
sequence for counting the number of real, unique roots in a range.

These functions can be exported by name or by tag (:classical, :numeric,
:sturm, and :utility). The utility tag exports the functions that 
are used internally and which previously were private to the module.
See the documentation for more information.

Using the classical methods, the cubic may be solved by the method
described by R. W. D. Nickalls, "A New Approach to solving the cubic:
Cardan's solution revealed," The Mathematical Gazette, 77, 354-359, 1993.
Dr. Nickalls has made his paper available at
<http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf>, one of his
many publications at <http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/rwdnPapers.html>

The solution for the quartic is based on Ferrari's method, as described
in the web page Karl's Calculus Tutor,
<http://www.karlscalculus.org/quartic.html>.
