Copyright (c) 2001 John M. Gamble. All rights reserved. This program is

This package works with perl version 5.004_04. It is written in pure
perl.

This package provides a set of functions that find the roots of
polynomials up to degree 4.  We are limited to that degree because there
is no exact solution for polynomials of 5th degree or higher, and I have
not implemented a numerical root-finder yet.

The solution for the cubic is based on an article by R. W. D. Nickalls,
"A New Approach to solving the cubic: Cardan's solution revealed," The
Mathematical Gazette, 77, 354-359, 1993. This article is available on
the web at http://www.m-a.org.uk/eb/mg/mg077ch.pdf.

The solution for the quartic is based on Ferrari's method, as described
in the web page Karl's Calculus Tutor,
http://www.netsrq.com/~hahn/quartic.html.
