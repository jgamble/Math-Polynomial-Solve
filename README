This package provides a set of functions that find the roots of
polynomials up to degree 4 using the classical methods, and a function
for solving polynomials of any degree with an implementation by an
implementation of the QR Hessenberg algorithm.

The cubic is solved by the method described by R. W. D. Nickalls, "A New
Approach to solving the cubic: Cardan's solution revealed," The
Mathematical Gazette, 77, 354-359, 1993. Dr. Nickalls has made his paper
available at <http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf>.

The solution for the quartic is based on Ferrari's method, as described
in the web page Karl's Calculus Tutor,
<http://www.karlscalculus.org/quartic.html>.

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The usual way.  Unpack the archive:
	gzip -d Math-Polynomial-Solve-2.50.tar.gz
	tar xvf Math-Polynomial-Solve-2.50.tar

This package now makes use of Module::Build, and the Build.PL script,
but you can still use Makefile.PL, which is provided:

Go into the resulting directory, and type:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make

Run the tests:
	make test

Install the module:
	make install

Alternatively, you can use Build.PL:
	perl Build.PL
	perl Build

Run the tests:
	perl Build test

Install the module:
	perl Build install

See the documentation for Module::Build for more information.
