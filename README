This package provides a set of functions that find the roots of
polynomials up to degree 4 using the classical methods; a function
for solving polynomials of any degree by an implementation of the
QR Hessenberg algorithm; and functions that implement Sturm's
sequence for counting the number of real, unique roots in a range.

These functions can be exported by name or by tag (:classical, :numeric,
:sturm, and :utility). The utility tag exports the functions that 
are used internally and which previously were private to the module.
See the documentation for more information.

Using the classical methods, the cubic may be solved by the method
described by R. W. D. Nickalls, "A New Approach to solving the cubic:
Cardan's solution revealed," The Mathematical Gazette, 77, 354-359, 1993.
Dr. Nickalls has made his paper available at
<http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf>.

The solution for the quartic is based on Ferrari's method, as described
in the web page Karl's Calculus Tutor,
<http://www.karlscalculus.org/quartic.html>.

Installation:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The usual way.  Unpack the archive:
	gzip -d Math-Polynomial-Solve-2.63.tar.gz
	tar xvf Math-Polynomial-Solve-2.63.tar

This package now makes use of Module::Build, and the Build.PL script,
but you can still use Makefile.PL, which is provided:

Go into the resulting directory, and type:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make

Run the tests:
	make test

Install the module:
	make install

Alternatively, you can use Build.PL:
	perl Build.PL
	perl Build

Run the tests:
	perl Build test

Install the module:
	perl Build install

See the documentation for Module::Build for more information.
