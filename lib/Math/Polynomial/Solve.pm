=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package supplies a set of functions that find the roots of
polynomials, along with some utility functions.

Roots will be either real or of type L<Math::Complex>.

Functions making use of the Sturm sequence are also available, letting you
find the number of real roots present in a range of X values.

In addition to the root-finding functions, the internal functions have
also been exported for your use.

=head1 EXPORT

There is an B<all> tag that exports everything.

Currently there is one default export, L<coefficients|coefficients()>.

If you want to have more fine-grained control you may
individually name the functions in an export list, or
use one four export tags:

L<classical|Classical Functions>,
L<numeric|Numeric Functions>,
L<sturm|Sturm Functions>,
L<utility|Utility Functions>,

=head2 EXPORTED BY DEFAULT

=head3 coefficients

Changes the default order of the coefficents to the functions.

When Math::Polynomial::Solve was originally written, it followed the
calling convention of L<Math::Polynomial>, using the highest degree
coefficient, followed by the next highest degree coefficient, and so
on in descending order.

Later Math::Polynomial was re-written, and the order of the coefficients were
put in ascending order, e.g.:

    use Math::Polynomial;

    #
    # Create the polynomial 8*x**3 - 6*x - 1.
    #
    $fpx = Math::Polynomial->new(-1, -6, 0, 8);

If you use Math::Polynomial with this module, it will probably be
more convenient to change the default parameter list of
Math::Polynomial::Solve's functions, using the coefficients() function:

    use Math::Polynomial;
    use Math::Polynomial::Solve qw(:all);

    coefficients order => 'ascending';

    my $fp4 = Math::Polynomial->interpolate([1 .. 4], [14, 19, 25, 32]);

    my @fp4_roots = poly_roots($fp4->coefficients);

If C<coefficients order =E<gt> 'ascending'> had not been called, the
previous line of code would have been written instead as

    my @fp4_roots = poly_roots(reverse $fp4->coefficients);

The function is a way to help with the change in the API when version 3.00 of
this module is released. At that point coefficients will be in ascending
order by default, and you will need to use
C<coefficients order =E<gt> 'descending'> to use the old (current) style.

=head3 is_ascending()

Returns C<1> if the coefficent order is ascending, C<0> if the order is descending.

    if (is_ascending())
    {
        print "Please enter your coefficients from lowest power to highest: ";
    }
    else
    {
        print "Please enter your coefficients from highest power to lowest: ";
    }

=head2 Numeric Functions

These are the functions that calculate the polynomial's roots through numeric
algorithms. They are all exported under the tag "numeric".

=head3 poly_roots()

Returns the roots of a polynomial equation, regardless of degree.
Unlike the other root-finding functions, it will check for coefficients
of zero for the highest power, and 'step down' the degree of the
polynomial to the appropriate case. Additionally, it will check for
coefficients of zero for the lowest power terms, and add zeros to its
root list before calling one of the root-finding functions.

By default, C<poly_roots()> will use the Hessenberg matrix method for solving
polynomials. This can be changed by calling L</poly_option()>.

The method of poly_roots() is almost equivalent to

    @x = hqr_eigen_hessenberg(
          balance_matrix(build_companion(@coefficients))
          );

except this wouldn't check for leading and trailing zero coefficients, and it
ignores the settings of C<poly_option()>.

=head3 poly_option()

Set options that affect the behavior of the C<poly_roots()> function. All
options are set to either 1 ("on") or 0 ("off"). See also L</poly_iteration()>
and L</poly_tolerance()>.

Options may be set and saved:

    #
    # Set a few options...
    #
    poly_option(hessenberg => 0, root_function => 1);

    #
    # Get all of the current options and their values.
    #
    my %all_options = poly_option();

    #
    # Set some options but save the former option values
    # for later.
    #
    my %changed_options = poly_option(hessenberg => 1, varsubst => 1);

The current options available are:

=over 4

=item 'hessenberg'

Use the QR Hessenberg matrix method to solve the polynomial. By default, this
is set to 1. If set to 0, C<poly_roots()> uses one of the L<classical|Classical Functions>
root-finding functions listed below, I<if> the degree of the polynomial is four
or less.

=item 'root_function'

Use the L<root()|Math::Complex/OPERATIONS> function from Math::Complex if the
polynomial is of the form C<ax**n + c>. This will take precedence over the other
solving methods.

=item 'varsubst'

Reduce polynomials to a lower degree through variable substitution, if possible.

For example, with C<varsubst> set to one and the polynomial to solve being
C<9x**6 + 128x**3 + 21>, C<poly_roots()> will reduce the polynomial to
C<9y**2 + 128y + 21> (where C<y = x**3>),
and solve the quadratic (either classically or numerically, depending
on the hessenberg option). Taking the cube root of each quadratic root
completes the operation.

This has the benefit of having a simpler matrix to solve, or if the
C<hessenberg> option is set to zero, has the effect of being able to use one of
the classical methods on a polynomial of high degree. In the above example, the
order-six polynomial gets solved with the quadratic_roots() function if the
hessenberg option is zero.

Currently the variable substitution is fairly simple and will only look
for gaps of zeros in the coefficients that are multiples of the prime numbers
less than or equal to 37 (2, 3, 5, et cetera).

=head3 build_companion

Creates the initial companion matrix of the polynomial. Returns an array
of arrays (the internal representation of a matrix). This may be used as
an argument to the L<Math::Matrix> contructor:

    my @cm = build_companion(@coef);

    my $m = Math::Matrix->new(@cm);
    $m->print();

of the matrix differ greatly in magnitude.

=head2 Sturm Functions

These are the functions that create and make use of the Sturm sequence.
They are all exported under the tag "sturm".

=head3 poly_real_root_count()

Return the number of I<unique>, I<real> roots of the polynomial.

    $unique_roots = poly_real_root_count(@coefficients);

For example, the equation C<(x + 3)**3> forms the polynomial
C<x**3 + 9x**2 + 27x + 27>, but since all three of its roots are identical,
C<poly_real_root_count(1, 9, 27, 27)> will return 1.

Likewise, C<poly_real_root_count(1, -8, 25)> will return 0 because the two roots
of C<x**2 -8x + 25> are both complex.

This function is the all-in-one function to use instead of

    my @chain = poly_sturm_chain(@coefficients);

    return sturm_sign_count(sturm_sign_minus_inf(\@chain)) -
            sturm_sign_count(sturm_sign_plus_inf(\@chain));

if you don't intend to use the Sturm chain for anything else.

    my @chain = poly_sturm_chain(@coefficients);
    $root_count = sturm_real_root_range_count(\@chain, $x0, $x1);

Returns the chain of Sturm functions used to evaluate the number of roots of a

If you feed in a sequence of X values to the Sturm functions, you can tell where
the (real, not complex) roots of the polynomial are by counting the number of
times the Y values change sign.

=head3 Sturm Sign Sequence Functions

=head4 sturm_sign_chain()

=head4 sturm_sign_minus_inf()

=head4 sturm_sign_plus_inf()

These functions return the array of signs that are used by the functions
L</poly_real_root_count()> and L</sturm_real_root_range_count()> to find
the number of real roots in a polynomial.

In normal use you will probably never need to use them, unless you want
to examine the internals of the Sturm functions:

    #
    # Examine the sign changes that occur at each endpoint of
    # the x range.
    #
    my(@coefficients) = (1, 4, 7, 23);
    my(@xvals) = (-12, 12);

    my @chain = poly_sturm_chain( @coefficients);
    my @signs = sturm_sign_chain(\@chain, \@xvals);  # An array of arrays.

    print "\nPolynomial: [", join(", ", @coefficients), "]\n";

    for my $j (0..$#signs)
    {
        my @s = @{$signs[$j]};
        print $xval[$j], "\n",
              "\t", join(", ", @s), "], sign count = ",
              sturm_sign_count(@s), "\n\n";
    }

Similar examinations can be made at plus and minus infinity:

    #
    # Examine the sign changes that occur between plus and minus
    # infinity.
    #
    my @coefficients = (1, 4, 7, 23);

    my @chain = poly_sturm_chain( @coefficients);
    my @smi = sturm_sign_minus_inf(\@chain);
    my @spi = sturm_sign_plus_inf(\@chain);

    print "\nPolynomial: [", join(", ", @coefficients), "]\n";

    print "Minus Inf:\n",
          "\t", join(", ", @smi), "], sign count = ",
          sturm_sign_count(@smi), "\n\n";

=head2 Utility Functions

These are internal functions used by the other functions listed above
that may also be useful to the user, or which affect the behavior of
other functions. They are all exported under the tag "utility".

=head3 epsilon()

Returns the machine epsilon value that was calculated when this module was
loaded.

The value may be changed, although this in general is not recommended.

    my $old_epsilon = epsilon($new_epsilon);

The previous value of epsilon may be saved to be restored later.

The Wikipedia article at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon/> has
more information on the subject.

=head3 laguerre()

A numerical method for finding a root of an equation, especially made
for polynomials.

    @roots = laguerre(\@coefficients, \@xvalues);
    push @roots, laguerre(\@coefficients, $another_xvalue);

For each x value the function will attempt to find a root closest to it.
The function will return real roots only.

This is the function used by L</sturm_bisection_roots()> after using
L</sturm_bisection()> to narrow its search to a range containing a single
root.

=head3 newtonraphson()

Like L</laguerre()>, a numerical method for finding a root of an equation.

    @roots = newtonraphson(\@coefficients, \@xvalues);
    push @roots, newtonraphson(\@coefficients, $another_xvalue);

For each x value the function will attempt to find a root closest to it.
The function will return real roots only.

This function is provided as an alternative to laguerre(). It is not
used internally by any other functions.

=head3 poly_iteration()

Sets the limit to the number of iterations that a solving method may go
through before giving up trying to find a root. Each method of root-finding
used by L</poly_roots()>, L</sturm_bisection_roots()>, and L</laguerre()>
has its own iteration limit, which may be found, like L</poly_option()>,
simply by looking at the return value of poly_iteration().

    #
    # Get all of the current iteration limits.
    #
    my %its_limits = poly_iteration();

    #
    # Double the limit for the hessenberg method, but set the limit
    # for Laguerre's method to 20.
    #
    my %old_limits = poly_iteration(hessenberg => $its_limits{hessenberg} * 2,
                        laguerre => 20);

    #
    # Reset the limits with the former values, but save the values we had
    # for later.
    #
    my %hl_limits = poly_iteration(%old_limits);

There are iteration limit values for:

=over 4

=item 'hessenberg'

The numeric method used by poly_roots(), if the hessenberg option is set.
Its default value is 60.

=item 'laguerre'

The numeric method used by L</laguerre()>. Laguerre's method is used within
sturm_bisection_roots() once it has narrowed its search in on an individual
root, and of course laguerre() may be called independently. Its default value
is 60.

=item 'newtonraphson'

The numeric method used by newtonraphson(). The Newton-Raphson method is offered
as an alternative to Laguerre's method.  Its default value is 60.

=item 'sturm_bisection'

The bisection method used to find roots within a range. Its default value
is 100.

		{
			croak "poly_iteration(): unknown key $k.";
		}
	}

	return %old_limits;
}

=head3 poly_tolerance()

Set the degree of accuracy needed for comparisons to be equal or roots
to be found.  Amongst the root finding functions this currently only
affects laguerre() and newtonraphson(), as the Hessenberg matrix method
determines how close it needs to get using a complicated formula based
on L</epsilon()>.

    #
    # Print the tolerances.
    #
    my %tolerances = poly_tolerance();
    print "Default tolerances:\n";
    for my $k (keys %tolerances)

    }

    #
    # Quadruple the tolerance for Laguerre's method.
    #
    poly_tolerance(laguerre => 4 * $tolerances{laguerre});

Tolerances may be set for:

=over 4

=item 'laguerre'

The numeric method used by laguerre(). Laguerre's method is used within
sturm_bisection_roots() once an individual root has been found within a
range, and of course it may be called independently.

The numeric method used by newtonraphson(). Newton-Raphson is, like
Laguerre's method, a method for finding a root near the starting X value.

=head2 The cubic

The cubic is solved by the method described by R. W. D. Nickalls, "A New
Approach to solving the cubic: Cardan's solution revealed," The
Mathematical Gazette, 77, 354-359, 1993.

Dr. Nickalls was kind enough to send me his article, with notes and
revisions, and directed me to a Matlab script that was based on that
article, written by Herman Bruyninckx, of the Dept. Mechanical Eng.,
Div. PMA, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. This function is an
almost direct translation of that script, and I owe Herman Bruyninckx
for creating it in the first place. 

Beginning with version 2.51, Dr. Nickalls's paper is included in the references
directory of this package. Dr. Nickalls has also made his paper available at
L<http://www.nickalls.org/dick/papers/maths/cubic1993.pdf>.

This article is also available on 2dcurvses.com, L<http://www.2dcurves.com/cubic/cubic.html>,
and there is a nice discussion of his method at S.O.S. Math,
L<http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/factor/fac111/fac111.html>.

His matlab cubic solver is at

Andy Stein has written a version of cubic.m that will work with
vectors.  It is included with this package in the C<eg> directory.

=head2 The quartic

The method for quartic solution is Ferrari's, as described in the web
page Encyclopedia of Mathematics at L<https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Ferrari_method>.
I also made use of some short cuts mentioned in web page Ask Dr. Math FAQ,
at L<http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.cubic.equations.html>

=head2 Quintic and higher.

Back when this module could only solve polynomials of degrees 1 through 4,
Matz Kindahl, the original author of Math::Polynomial, suggested the
C<poly_roots()> function. Later on, Nick Ing-Simmons, who was working on a
perl binding to the GNU Scientific Library, sent a perl translation of Hiroshi
Murakami's Fortran implementation of the QR Hessenberg algorithm, and it
fit very well into the C<poly_roots()> function. Quintics and higher degree
polynomials can now be solved, albeit through numeric analysis methods.

Hiroshi Murakami's Fortran routines were at
L<http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/>, but do not seem to be available
from that source anymore. However, his files have been located and are now
included in the C<references/qralg> directory of this package.

He referenced the following articles:
